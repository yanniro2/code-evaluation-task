# Carousel Component - Stoppers Assignment

This project implements a carousel component based on the design provided in the Figma file. Though the assignment specifies HTML, SCSS, and JavaScript, I utilized **Next.js**, **React**, **Tailwind CSS**, and **TypeScript** to showcase my proficiency in modern frontend frameworks and enhance the efficiency of the development process.

The project is deployed on **Vercel** for easy access and review.

## Project Overview

This is a responsive and fully functional carousel component. It smoothly transitions between slides, adhering to the design in the provided Figma file. The component is modular, scalable, and easy to maintain.

While the initial task was based on HTML, SCSS, and JavaScript, I opted for **Next.js** and **Tailwind CSS** to leverage their efficiency in handling UI components, responsiveness, and performance.

## Technologies Used

- **Next.js**: For the base framework.
- **React**: For component-based UI development.
- **Tailwind CSS**: To implement responsive and scalable styling.
- **TypeScript**: To ensure type safety and catch potential errors during development.
- **Vercel**: For deployment and hosting.

## Project Structure

The project follows a typical Next.js folder structure:
├── components/
├── data/
├── public/images/avatars/#png images
├── app/fonts,

## Running the Project Locally

1. Clone the repository:
``<git@github.com>:yanniro2/code-evaluation-task.git

2. Install dependencies:
``npm install

3. Start the development server:
``npm run dev

4. Open `http://localhost:3000` to view the carousel in your browser.

## Design Implementation

- **Poppins** font is imported from Google Fonts, and **Recoleta** font is imported locally as provided.
- The carousel transitions are smooth and follow the design specifications.
- The project is fully responsive, ensuring compatibility across different screen sizes.
- **SCSS principles** like DRY, and variables for colors and spacing are integrated through Tailwind's utility-first approach.
- **BEM methodology** is applied to ensure organized and maintainable class naming.

## Assumptions & Decisions

- Although the task requested SCSS, I chose **Tailwind CSS** for quicker responsiveness and maintainability.
- The carousel state and behavior are managed using React's state and hooks, instead of plain JavaScript classes, for easier scalability.
- I chose **Next.js** to streamline the project setup and simplify deployment to Vercel.

## Deployment
